This is a basic website that tries to create a 3D model of the solar system using Three.js. To run the program you can use the glitch.com website and you will need the solar-system.html file, three.js file, OrbitControls.js file, and the assets folder.
For the assets, you'll need to add them to the Assets in glitch first
